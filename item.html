					___________________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>
					When you buy the cage, make sure the size is enough for your hamster to run around. If you look for wire 
					cages, ensure the gap is not allow your hamster to escape. Practically all cages set come with a hamster wheel, 
					water bottle, food bowl and some tunnels attached.

					___________________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>
					Most people make use of wood shavings. Provide wood shaving will also keep hamster in a warm envirnment. M
					y opinion for the wood  shaving is choose the wood shaving without any fragrance. You also can choose the 
					paper bedding instead of wood shaving.

					___________________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>
					Prepare a small house for your hamster, it will provide a peace place to sleep or hide, you can put some 
					tissue or cotton in it to make it comfortable and warm. Also some hamster will use it as a toilet, no matter what is 
					the uses of the house, it is a necessary piece in cage. Be sure to keep it clean, since your hamster may 
					store food in the house.

					Wheel
					</div>
					___________________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>
					The most important thing in the cage should be wheel. Running is a great exercise, it will let your 
					hamster stay healthy, not get too fat, and it also can keep mentally healthy.

					___________________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>
					The main types of hamster foods is muesli and pellets. You can purchase from pet store, choose the same 
					food everytime if possible. Sudden food change will make your hamster feel incommensurate. Feed some 
					appropriate fruit and vegetable sometime is a good idea.

					</div>
					___________________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>
					hamster Ball is one kind of the running toy, put your hamster  into the ball, and they will run to 
					everywhere, and also easy to catch. When you clean the cage, move hamster into the ball, then you can 
					clean the cage easy.

					___________________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>
					Hamster love toys, you can buy it from store or you can make it by youself. Hamster's teeth grow 
					continuously, so gnaw toys will help wear down hamster's teeth. Wooden toy will serve as chew toy too. If there are no
					any chew toy in the cage, hamster will try to chew other thing, they may break te  cage. 
					Hamster will feel boring without toys.

					<img src=" assets/images/water_bottle1.jpg" alt="Water Bottle" style="width:203px;height:182px;">
					<img src=" assets/images/water_bottle2.jpg" alt="Water Bottle" style="width:203px;height:182px;">
					<div class = "item_Name">
					Water Bottle
					</div>
					___________________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>
					Contrast to the water bowl, I recommend water bottle, water bottle is more hygiene than water bowl, 
					since when hamster run around, maybe make some wood shaving drop into the water bowl, that will make 
					the water dirty. You hamster will automatically know how to use the water bottle, so, don't worry about 
					that.

					<div class = "item_Name">
					Food Bowl
					</div>
					___________________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>
					Have a food bowl for you hamster will help you to observe how much food your hamster will eating in one day.

					<div class = "item_Name">
					Sand for Bath
					</div>
					___________________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>
					Hamster are susceptible to catching cold, so don't use water for bath, unless emergency. If their 
					fur slightly greasy, give them bathing sand, they will roll in the sand and "bathing".
