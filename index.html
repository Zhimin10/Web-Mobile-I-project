			<p>Hamsters are belong to the rodent family and there are many different hamster species in the world. Hamsters already 
			become most popular small pet, since they are easy to breeding and care for. Most hamsters inhabit semi-desert areas where 
			they live in burrows that consist of many tunnels. Hamsters are nocturnal, they always sleeping during the daytime, and being
			most active at night. They have poor eyesight but they have excellent sense of smell and hearing. Most hamsters will use their 
			expandable cheek pouches to carry food and bring back to their burrow, then eat it later, that's their natural instincts.
